      Bram Stoker's Dracula appeared first in 1897. It caught the public interest at a tune when the supernatural -
ghost stories and accounts of events that cannot be explained -had come into fashion. It was an immediate
success, and it was followed - and continues to be followed, thanks partly to films and television - by very many
other stories about vampires and other "ghoulies and ghosties and long-legged beasties and things that go bump
in the night".
     Dracula was not the first story about the vampire myths. There had been many mentions of them, and
Heinrich Marschner's opera Der Vampyr was popular in German opera houses long before 1897. For one more
example, Lord Byron's story-poem The Giaour (1813) has the lines:
    But first on earth, as vampire sent,
     Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent.
    Then ghastly haunt thy native place
     And suck the blood of all thy race.
      and all his readers would have understood the reference. But it is to Dracula that people turn for the full
taste of the old myths. And it is the name "Dracula" that is known (with variations in pronunciation) in nearly
every part of the world. The tape recording of this book, read by a well-known actor, will give you an idea of
how exciting the story can sound.
